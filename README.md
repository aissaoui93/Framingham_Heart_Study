# Framingham_Heart_Study
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. About 7.4 million people died from coronary heart disease (CHD) in 2012, which is 13% of all deaths that year across the globe. 


In the late 1940s, the U.S. government took steps to study cardiovascular disease. In order develop high quality data for their study, they decided to track a large cohort of initially-healthy people over time. The town of Framingham, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston) was selected as the site for the study, which commenced in 1948. The study enrolled 5,209 participants aged 30-62. Participants were given a questionnaire and a medical exam every two years. They also collected data on the participants' physical characteristics and behavioral characteristics, in addition to the medical test data. Over the years, the study has expanded to include multiple generations and has collected many more factors including genetic information. This data is now famously known and is simply called the Framingham Heart Study. 



In this small project, we try to build models using Framingham Heart Study data in order to predict CHD and make recommendations to better prevent heart disease. The dataset is the framingham.csv. There are 3,658 observations, with each observation representing the data from a particular study participant. There are 16 variables in the dataset.
